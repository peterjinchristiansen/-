[Submitted after deadline]

***I am still planning on submitting my finished project relatively soon. Even if I'm being failed, I was wondering if it would be possible to still get feedback on it, as I feel it would be quite useful for my growth.

## Summary

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete my final project. I chose to opt out of doing my 3rd group project with my cohort because I knew I wouldn't be able to contribute. I managed to finish everything else, so that actually turned out to be the reason I probably don't pass.

My plan was to create a website for students to find and join study groups.

## Challenges

Due to my shortage of time, I initally was going to recycle code from my other projects to speed up initialization, and rewriting parts of it to make it relevant to my needs. I soon realized how much quality as well as functionality I would have to sacrifice to get things done in time. Since the extension started, I always took great care to make sure my submissions were the highest possible quality I could produce with my current ability, so turning in something so sloppy just wouldn't feel right. For that reason, as well as the pressure finally starting to get to me, I scrapped the project on the last day. './notes.txt' is the start of my general plan for when I try to make this in a more sophisticated manner. I am also planning for this to be the first project I put on my portfolio.

My first commit for Challenge 9 was on September 27th, so I had to learn everything from sections 2 and 3 of the bootcamp (aside from weeks 19 & 22), as well as completed 10 Challenges, in 38 days by myself. As I averaged around 14 hours a day since then, it impresses me that the full-time course would have completed this in 35.
